## Creating a Netlify Plugin

Visit this doc for more information on [how to create a Netlify plugin](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/build-plugins/create-plugins/).

## Testing

End-to-end tests are in folder [tests](tests) and they use this [plugin locally](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/build-plugins/create-plugins/#local-plugins) and build each subfolder using Netlify CLI on CircleCI. You can find the test recordings at [Cypress Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/ixroqc/).

To run locally:

- `npx netlify link` once
- from every subfolder of `tests` execute `npm run build`

### Authentication (local)

- use `netlify-cli` to authenticate locally. It will also create a local site and store its ID in `.netlify` folder (ignored by `git`)

### Authentication (ci)

To authenticate `netlify` on CircleCI:
- grab the Settings > Site information > APP ID and set it as environment variable `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`
- generate new authentication token for CI from User Settings > Applications > New Access Token and set it as environment variable `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`

## Releasing a new version

Before releasing check that each CircleCI job has actually run the tests correctly. We don't have a way to check if Cypress _executed all tests_, other than looking at the CircleCI terminal output.

Try using `beta` branch to release new pre-release versions of the plugin by following [the semantic release guide](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/recipes/pre-releases.md). You can fork and test out new versions published to NPM using the [netlify-plugin-cypress-example](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress-example) repository. Hope the `master` branch merged into `beta` does not bring features and fixes *already released*. Thus I suggest using `beta` branch for new features.

**Do not open pull request on CircleCI** while adding new features to the `beta` branch. If there is a pull request, semantic-release refuses to publish new versions. Instead just watch the [builds on CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress/tree/beta) directly and open the PR after the new version has been tested.
